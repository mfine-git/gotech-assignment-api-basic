GoTech Home Assignment
In this project you will a Dockerfile and deployment of a Rest Api.
The emphasis of the assignment is correct architecture, using cloud resources and
keeping it simple for both future maintenance and use.
Project Details:
1. The project is a git repo of a rest-api, built with Express.js & TypeScript
https://github.com/gotech-io/gotech-assignment-api
2. The API has 2 dependencies that it requires to run properly
1. PostgreSQL database
2. Redis cache
3. The API exposes a GET request under the path of /health that validates both DB
connection & Redis connection, returning HTTP 200 if everything is connected
4. The API receives runtime parameters via environment variables
5. All the knowledge you need to run the project locally is written in the README file
6. All relevant commands for building/running the project can be found in the
package.json file
Assignment Details:
1. Write a Dockerfile for this project, pay attention to docker image size, try to make
it relatively small.
2. Write a script or yaml to deploy the dockerized API to AWS cloud.
this could be IoC as Terraform/Pulumi/AWS CDK or it could be a bash/python
script that provisions the resources.
3. One of the goals of this exercise is to make the deployment as easy to manage as
possible, meaning we would prefer to use resources managed by AWS.
4. Pay attention to architecture and structure.
